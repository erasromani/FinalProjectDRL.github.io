## Introduction
Recent groundbreaking success in deep reinforcement learning(DRL) has attracted widespread interest. Recent research revealed that deep reinforcement learning has potential to solove optimization problem like travelling salesman problem\[[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09940.pdf)\] ,vehicle routing problem \[[2](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8190-reinforcement-learning-for-solving-the-vehicle-routing-problem.pdf)\][3]\[(https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3394486.3403356)\], 


DRL agents can achieve human-level or even better control performance in varied fields,including robotics, game playing, self-driving and many others. In traffic area, DiDi,which is one of the leading  ride-hailing companies, has successfully deployed DRL agents for their order dispatch system.Due to high dimensionality of such systems, many complex dispatch systems can be improved using reinforcement learning agents. 

Morever, reinforcement learning has been showed
